name: job-search
description: Use when the candidate wants to run a job search — "find jobs for me", "run job search", "search for jobs", "what's new today". Requires context/profile.md and configs/search.json to already exist (run onboard first if not). Asks which sources to use, fetches LinkedIn and/or company career-site postings, scores them against the profile, and pushes results to Google Sheets. Ends at the sheet and offers to hand off to tailor-resumes — it does not generate resumes itself.

## Prerequisites

1. `context/profile.md` and `configs/search.json` must both exist. If either is missing, tell the candidate to run onboarding first (say: "I don't have your profile yet — let's onboard you first") and stop. Do not improvise a config from a conversation alone.
2. Ensure the project venv is ready: if `.venv/` doesn't exist, create it and `.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt`. All commands below use `.venv/bin/python`; on Windows that path is `.venv\Scripts\python` (see README's Supported platforms).
3. **Connections pre-flight**: invoke the `connections` skill with scope `apify,sheets`. Credentials can expire or be revoked between runs, so this is checked every time — but it's silent when everything's fine, and only becomes a conversation if something's actually broken. **Never inspect `.env` yourself**; `connections` owns that entirely.

If any of the required steps below fails, print the error and stop. Do not silently fall back or skip a required step without saying so.

## Steps

0. **Ask which sources.** Every run, before fetching: *"LinkedIn only, company career sites only, or both?"* Skip this question entirely if `configs/companies.json` doesn't exist — there's nothing to choose between, so just use LinkedIn. Their answer decides which of steps 1 and 2 run.

1. **Fetch — LinkedIn.** This one call blocks for several minutes with nothing visible
   until it returns, so **say what's about to happen before you run it** — how many
   searches, how long, and where the results land:

   > *"Searching LinkedIn via Apify — 12 searches (6 roles × province + remote). The
   > actor run usually takes 3–6 minutes, then about 5 more verifying each listing is
   > still open. Results go to `outputs/raw_linkedin.json`. I'll report back when it's
   > done."*

   Read the actual URL count from the config rather than guessing: 2 URLs per target
   role when `include_remote_in_country` is on, 1 otherwise.

   ```
   .venv/bin/python scripts/fetch_jobs.py --config configs/search.json --raw-out outputs/raw_linkedin.json
   ```
   - Verifies each posting is still open by hitting `https://www.linkedin.com/jobs-guest/jobs/api/jobPosting/<id>` — a listing with no `top-card-layout__cta--primary` button is dropped as closed. Serial + 1s delay (~5 min for a few hundred postings). Disable with `"verify_listings": false` in the config only if a fast fetch is needed and closed listings will be filtered downstream. Postings the verifier can't reach are kept.
   - The Apify poll has a hard 20-minute ceiling. If it hits that, say so — don't retry silently.

2. **Fetch — company career sites** (if chosen in step 0). Walk the companies **one at a
   time** and report each as it completes, so this leg is visible progress rather than
   another silent multi-minute block.

   If `configs/companies.json` doesn't exist, skip this step entirely and proceed with
   LinkedIn only — don't block the search on an optional source.

   First, clear last run's per-company files and list what's fetchable:
   ```
   mkdir -p outputs/raw_companies && rm -f outputs/raw_companies/*.json
   .venv/bin/python scripts/fetch_companies.py --config configs/companies.json --list
   ```
   `--list` prints `name<TAB>ats` for companies with a confirmed API. Then one call each,
   announcing the company **before** the call and its count after:
   ```
   .venv/bin/python scripts/fetch_companies.py --config configs/companies.json --only "RBC" --raw-out outputs/raw_companies/rbc.json
   ```
   Most of the config's 26 companies are `"ats": "custom"` with no public API and are not
   listed — mention the skipped count once at the end of the loop, not per company.

   A single company failing is logged and skipped, not fatal — carry on with the rest and
   name the failures in the summary.

3. **Score**: `.venv/bin/python scripts/score_jobs.py --config configs/search.json --raw-in outputs/raw_linkedin.json outputs/raw_companies/*.json --scored-out outputs/scored.json`
   - `--raw-in` takes one or more paths — pass whichever of the two sources actually ran. The glob expands to one file per company from step 2; if only LinkedIn ran, pass just that path.
   - Match Score is 0–100: `round((skill_weights_matched + title_bonus − experience_penalty) / (sum_of_all_skill_weights + title_match_bonus) × 100)`. Anything that computes to ≤0 is dropped. Postings below `min_match_score` are dropped.
   - Dedupes twice: first by exact link, then by normalized (company, title) so the same posting mirrored across LinkedIn and a company's own site collapses to one row (keeping whichever copy has the richer description).
   - **Country filter**: keeps any posting anywhere in `location.country` (not just the candidate's province), plus remote postings mentioning the country — word-boundary-safe matching, not naive substring (a past bug let "ON" match inside "London"; fixed).
   - **Age filter**: drops postings older than `max_posting_age_days` (default 7). Postings whose date can't be parsed (mainly some Workday listings using relative text) are kept, not dropped — the printed summary reports how many.
   - Each scored row gets a stable `posting_id` (hash of its apply link, or company+title+location+source if no link) — the same posting produces the same ID across separate days, which is what makes the "New Since Last Run" column below possible. The summary line reports how many distinct IDs were verified.

4. **Push**: `.venv/bin/python scripts/push_to_sheets.py --scored-in outputs/scored.json --tab-name <YYYY-MM-DD>`
   - Tab is date-based — a new day starts a fresh tab. Same-day re-runs **merge** into the existing tab keyed by apply link — the fresher row wins on collision.
   - Before writing, compares today's posting IDs against the most recent *previous* date tab (skips the "Applications" tab and any tab from before this feature shipped) and marks each row's `New Since Last Run` column `Yes`/`No` accordingly — pure visibility, nothing is dropped based on this. The summary line reports the counts, or says so explicitly if there's no comparable previous tab yet.

5. Print the sheet URL and a one-line summary: "Pulled X raw (Y LinkedIn, Z company sites across N companies), kept M after scoring, wrote to tab `<date>` (P new since last sheet, Q already seen)." Name any company whose fetch failed.

6. **Offer resumes, don't generate them.** This skill ends at the sheet — the search results are banked and safe. Then hand off:

   > *"8 of those score above 60. Want tailored resumes for any of them?"*

   If yes, invoke the `tailor-resumes` skill (it handles selection, and owns the LaTeX-engine check). If no, stop — they can ask for resumes anytime later; `tailor-resumes` reads `outputs/scored.json` on its own.

## URL construction (what fetch_jobs.py does under the hood)

For every target role the fetcher builds two LinkedIn search URLs:
1. `keywords=<role>&location=<region, country>&f_TPR=r86400[&f_E=<seniority>]` — province-wide.
2. If `include_remote_in_country`: `keywords=<role>&location=<country>&f_WT=2&f_TPR=r86400[&f_E=<seniority>]`

So 5 target roles with remote enabled produce 10 URLs. Total results requested from Apify = `results_per_search × url_count`. `region_aliases` only affects this fetch-time URL construction (the province-scoped search) — the scorer's own filter (applied to every source, not just LinkedIn) is country-wide: it drops postings whose `location` string doesn't mention `country` and aren't a remote posting mentioning it either. Empty posting locations fail-open.

## What fetch_companies.py does under the hood

Reads `configs/companies.json`'s `companies` list, dispatching each by its `ats` field (verified against real API responses, not guessed):
- **Greenhouse**: `GET boards-api.greenhouse.io/v1/boards/{token}/jobs?content=true`
- **Lever**: `GET api.lever.co/v0/postings/{org}?mode=json`
- **Workday**: `POST {tenant}.{shard}.myworkdayjobs.com/wday/cxs/{tenant}/{site}/jobs` (paginated), then one `GET .../job{externalPath}` per posting for the full description

`results_per_company` in `configs/companies.json` caps how many postings are pulled per company (default 30). Adding a new company: confirm its actual ATS and identifiers first (visit its careers page, or probe the guessed API URL) — don't guess tenant/board/org values blind, they need to be real. Companies without a confirmed API stay in the config as `"ats": "custom"` with a note, and are skipped at fetch time rather than blocking the run.
