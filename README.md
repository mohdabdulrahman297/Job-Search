# Job Search OS

**Repository:** [github.com/SahilGogna/job-search-os](https://github.com/SahilGogna/job-search-os)

## What we're building

A local Python project that turns a resume PDF into a live list of matching job postings — from LinkedIn *and* company career sites — in a Google Sheet, plus a tailored resume PDF for every strong match and a read-only Gmail dashboard tracking what happened to each application. No deployment. No external LLM calls. Claude Code is the reasoning layer.

## Supported platforms

**macOS and Linux — tested.** All commands in this repo use the venv as `.venv/bin/python`.

**Windows — documented below, not yet verified.** The setup path has not been run
end to end on Windows; if you hit something this section doesn't cover, that's a gap in
the docs, not in your setup.

| | macOS / Linux | Windows |
|---|---|---|
| Python in the venv | `.venv/bin/python` | `.venv\Scripts\python` |
| pip in the venv | `.venv/bin/pip` | `.venv\Scripts\pip` |
| LaTeX engine | `brew install tectonic` | `winget install ArtifexSoftware.Tectonic` or `scoop install tectonic` |
| Markdown preview in VS Code | `Cmd+Shift+V` | `Ctrl+Shift+V` |
| Path to your service-account JSON | `/Users/you/Downloads/key.json` | `C:\Users\you\Downloads\key.json` |

You never need to base64-encode anything by hand on any platform — `/connections` does it
for you from the file path, so the old `base64 … | pbcopy` macOS recipe is gone.

## How it works end to end

1. Open Claude Code in this project folder. If it's your first time (no `context/profile.md` yet), it runs the **onboard** skill: give it your fullest resume PDF — a detailed, multi-page one covering every role, not a one-pager — and it reads it itself, figures out skills, location, and years of experience, proposes a list of target roles and **checks that list with you before locking it in**, then writes `context/profile.md` (your full profile) and `configs/search.json` (the derived search plan). It then invokes the **connections** skill, which walks you through `.env` (`APIFY_TOKEN`, `JSON_KEY_BASE_64`, `SHEET_ID`) one value at a time and confirms Gmail is connected — never blocking the rest of setup if you'd rather finish it later. Finally it asks whether you want Gmail application tracking enabled — say yes and it runs an initial scan right there.
2. From then on, just say *"find jobs for me"* — the **job-search** skill runs:
   - `scripts/fetch_jobs.py`, which calls Apify's LinkedIn Jobs Scraper (Curious Coder), filtered to the last 24 hours
   - `scripts/fetch_companies.py` (if `configs/companies.json` exists), which hits company career sites directly — Greenhouse, Lever, and Workday's public JSON APIs
   - `scripts/score_jobs.py`, which merges both sources, dedupes across them, and ranks postings against `configs/search.json`
   - `scripts/push_to_sheets.py`, which appends the ranked list to a Google Sheet
3. Claude Code prints the sheet URL and a one-line summary, then offers resumes — say yes and the **tailor-resumes** skill takes over: pick all, the top N, everything above a bar, or specific postings. You can also paste a JD for a job found anywhere else and get a resume for that. Kept separate from the search on purpose: by the time it runs, your results are already safely in the sheet.
4. Got a new cert, a new project, or a new resume? Say so — the **update-profile** skill handles all of it: small edits applied directly, a new resume PDF parsed and diffed against your profile so you can accept only what you want.
5. Anytime, say *"check my applications"* (or "update my dashboard") — the **application-tracker** skill does a read-only scan of Gmail for application-related emails (confirmations, interviews, offers, rejections), classifies each one, upserts the result into a dedicated **Applications** tab, and republishes a private **dashboard** (counts + "time to follow up" / "send a thank-you" flags) as a Claude Artifact at a stable URL. This dashboard is entirely independent of the job-postings Sheet — it's built purely from Gmail, doesn't know or care what's in the Sheet. It never modifies Gmail — no labels, no message changes, no drafted/sent emails, read-only.

## Why this design

* Claude Code does the resume parsing and search planning natively. No OpenAI or Anthropic API call from inside the code. The scripts are dumb: they consume a config and produce data
* Onboarding happens once, not on every search — your profile persists in `context/profile.md` instead of being re-derived from the PDF each time
* Every step is inspectable. If a run pulls weak results, open `configs/search.json` and see exactly what Claude Code decided
* Sources are portal-agnostic by design: every fetcher tags a `source` field and produces the same raw item shape, so `score_jobs.py`/`push_to_sheets.py` never needed to change to support company career sites alongside LinkedIn
* Google Sheets is the deliverable so you can filter, sort, and share without opening Excel
* Resume tailoring only reorders/emphasizes content already in your profile — it never invents experience

## Tech stack

* Python 3.11 or newer
* Apify REST API (Curious Coder LinkedIn Jobs Scraper)
* Greenhouse, Lever, and Workday public JSON APIs for company career sites
* Google Sheets API via service account
* `pdfplumber` for reading resumes
* `pandas` for data handling
* `gspread` and `google-auth` for Sheets writes
* `pyyaml` for reading `context/profile.md`'s structured data
* A LaTeX engine (`tectonic` or `pdflatex`) for compiling tailored resumes

## One-time setup

The **`/connections`** skill (invoked automatically by `/onboard`, or run standalone
anytime — "set up my API keys") walks you through all of this interactively, scaffolds
`.env` for you, gives you the complete sequence up front, and validates each value with a
real call rather than trusting it blindly. What follows is the same thing written out, for
reference or if you'd rather do it yourself.

**How secrets are handled.** No credential ever passes through the conversation. Claude
never reads `.env` — not even to check whether a key is set. You type `APIFY_TOKEN` and
`SHEET_ID` into `.env` yourself, in your own editor. For the Google service-account key,
you hand over the **file's path** and `scripts/set_env_value.py` base64-encodes it
in-process. Status comes back from `scripts/check_connections.py`, which prints only
`valid` / `invalid` / `missing`. `Read` on `.env` is denied in `.claude/settings.json`,
which is tracked, so the protection survives a fresh clone.

Claude will never ask you to paste, show, or confirm the *contents* of a credential. If it
ever does, something is wrong — the only credential-adjacent thing it should ask for is a
file path.

### Create `.env`

```
.venv/bin/python scripts/init_env.py
```

Creates `.env` from `example.env` if it doesn't exist and prints its path. It never
overwrites an existing file. Open it in your editor and keep it open — the values below go
straight into it.

### Apify

1. Create an account at https://console.apify.com
2. **Settings → API & Integrations**
3. Create a new token
4. Paste it into the `APIFY_TOKEN=` line in `.env` and save

### Google service account and sheet

All nine steps, in order. **Step 9 is the one people miss**, and nothing works without it.

1. Create a Google Cloud project — https://console.cloud.google.com
2. Enable the **Google Sheets API**
3. Enable the **Google Drive API**
4. **Credentials → Create Credentials → Service Account**
5. Skip every optional step — no grants or user access are needed
6. Open the service account → **Keys** tab → **Add Key → Create New Key → JSON** → download
7. Create the Google Sheet this project writes to, **signed in as the same Google account**
8. Copy the sheet ID out of its URL — the part between `/d/` and `/edit` — into the `SHEET_ID=` line in `.env`
9. **Share that sheet with the service account's `client_email`, as Editor.** The sheet is invisible to the service account until you do this.

Then store the key. **Do not paste the JSON into `.env`** — give Claude the file's path,
or run it yourself:

```
.venv/bin/python scripts/set_env_value.py --key JSON_KEY_BASE_64 --from-file-base64 /absolute/path/to/service-account.json
```

Two rules about that file:

- **Keep it outside this repo.** A credentials file inside a git working tree gets
  committed by accident, and that leaks the whole service account. Leave it in Downloads
  and reference it by absolute path. (`.gitignore` also blocks the obvious filenames, but
  that's a backstop, not the plan.)
- **Never open it and copy anything out.** Base64 of the whole file is the only supported
  encoding, and it exists precisely so you don't have to deal with the `private_key`
  field's literal `\n` sequences — they're carried through untouched. There is nothing to
  escape, unescape, quote, or strip. If `check_connections.py` says *"this is raw JSON,
  not base64"*, that line in `.env` was filled in by hand; clear it and use the path.

### Verify

```
.venv/bin/python scripts/check_connections.py --scope apify,sheets
```

Prints a status word per key and exits non-zero if anything needs attention. When
`JSON_KEY_BASE_64` is valid it also prints the service-account email — that's the address
step 9 needs. Common failures and their fixes:

| Message | Fix |
|---|---|
| `APIFY_TOKEN: invalid (rejected by Apify ...)` | Wrong or revoked token — make a new one and correct that line in `.env` |
| `JSON_KEY_BASE_64: invalid (this is raw JSON, not base64 ...)` | You pasted the file's contents; clear the line and use `--from-file-base64` with the path |
| `SHEET_ID: invalid (permission denied ...)` | Step 9 isn't done — share the sheet with the printed service-account email as Editor |
| `SHEET_ID: invalid (not found ...)` | Wrong ID, or the sheet belongs to a different Google account than the project |

### LaTeX engine (for tailored resumes)

Install one of:
```
brew install tectonic      # preferred — self-contained, no full TeX Live needed
```
or use an existing `pdflatex` install (e.g. MacTeX). The job-search skill checks for either automatically and tells you if neither is found.

### Your own resume template (optional)

`templates/resume_template.tex` ships with a working default (FAANGPath / Trey Hunner `resume.cls` format). Swap in your own `.tex` design any time — just keep the placeholder tokens documented in that file's header comment (`FULL_NAME`, `SUMMARY`, `SKILLS_LIST`, `EXPERIENCE_BLOCK`, etc.) and drop any custom `.cls`/`.sty` files in `templates/` alongside it.

## Config file schema

The onboard skill generates this from your profile. Example:

```json
{
  "candidate_name": "Jane Doe",
  "target_roles": ["Data Analyst", "BI Analyst", "Business Intelligence Analyst", "Analytics Engineer", "Junior Data Analyst", "Reporting Analyst"],
  "location": {
    "city": "Toronto",
    "region": "Ontario",
    "country": "Canada",
    "region_aliases": ["Ontario", "ON"],
    "include_remote_in_country": true
  },
  "experience_years": 2,
  "seniority_filter_codes": [2, 3, 4],
  "results_per_search": 50,
  "title_match_bonus": 6,
  "require_title_match": false,
  "min_match_score": 50,
  "resume_tailoring_min_score": 60,
  "max_posting_age_days": 7,
  "max_skill_lines": 2,
  "core_skills": {
    "python":    {"weight": 3, "variants": ["python", "pandas", "numpy"]},
    "sql":       {"weight": 3, "variants": ["sql", "mysql", "postgres"]},
    "power_bi":  {"weight": 3, "variants": ["power bi", "dax", "power query"]},
    "tableau":   {"weight": 2, "variants": ["tableau"]},
    "etl":       {"weight": 3, "variants": ["etl", "elt", "data pipeline"]},
    "cloud":     {"weight": 2, "variants": ["azure", "aws", "snowflake", "bigquery"]},
    "ml_ai":     {"weight": 2, "variants": ["nlp", "rag", "llm", "genai"]}
  },
  "exclude_title_terms": ["senior", "sr.", "lead", "principal", "staff", "manager", "director"],
  "max_experience_years_penalty": 5
}
```

`location.region_aliases` only affects `fetch_jobs.py`'s LinkedIn search-URL construction (one of its two searches is province-scoped, the other is country-wide + remote) — it does **not** restrict what the scorer keeps. The scorer's own location filter is country-wide: any posting located anywhere in `location.country`, or a remote posting mentioning that country, passes — a real fix, not just a design choice: an earlier version matched province code `"ON"` via naive substring search, which falsely matched inside the word "London" (`re.search(r"\bON\b", ...)` word-boundary matching now prevents that). `title_match_bonus` (default 6) is added when the job title contains any of the `target_roles` phrases — bump higher to make title alignment dominate. Set `require_title_match: true` to hard-drop postings whose titles don't match. `resume_tailoring_min_score` (default 60) is the threshold above which `generate_resumes.py` produces a tailored PDF. `max_posting_age_days` (default 7) drops postings older than a week — applies to every source; a posting whose date can't be determined is kept, not dropped, and counted separately in the summary line.

## Company career-site config (`configs/companies.json`)

Optional. If present, `job-search` also fetches postings directly from these companies' own career sites, alongside LinkedIn. Schema:

```json
{
  "results_per_company": 30,
  "companies": [
    {"name": "RBC", "ats": "workday", "tenant": "rbc", "shard": "wd3", "site": "RBCGLOBAL1"},
    {"name": "Some Startup", "ats": "greenhouse", "token": "somestartup"},
    {"name": "Another Co", "ats": "lever", "org": "anotherco"},
    {"name": "No API Co", "ats": "custom", "note": "no public API found — skipped at fetch time"}
  ]
}
```

`ats` selects the fetcher: `greenhouse` needs `token` (the `boards.greenhouse.io/<token>` slug), `lever` needs `org` (the `jobs.lever.co/<org>` slug), `workday` needs `tenant` + `shard` + `site` (from that company's `https://<tenant>.<shard>.myworkdayjobs.com/<site>` careers URL). Anything else (including `custom`) is skipped — logged, not fatal.

**Finding these values for a new company**: visit its careers page and watch the network tab, or search for `"<company> careers myworkdayjobs.com"` / check if `boards.greenhouse.io/<guess>` or `jobs.lever.co/<guess>` resolves. Don't guess and commit a value you haven't confirmed — a wrong tenant/token just 404s silently at fetch time (logged as a per-company failure, not caught any other way). The starter list shipped in this repo has each Workday entry verified this way; several other major employers are still marked `"custom"` pending that same check.

## Listing verification

Apify's search-page scraper doesn't tell us whether a posting is still accepting applications. After the fetch, `scripts/fetch_jobs.py` hits `https://www.linkedin.com/jobs-guest/jobs/api/jobPosting/<id>` for each result and drops any listing whose Apply button is missing (`top-card-layout__cta--primary`). Serial with a 1s delay to avoid LinkedIn's rate limit — expect ~5 min for a few hundred postings. Set `"verify_listings": false` in the config to skip.

## Match Score

The Sheet's Match Score column is a **0–100 percentage**: `round((skill_weights_matched + title_bonus − experience_penalty) / (sum_of_all_skill_weights + title_match_bonus) × 100)`. 100 means a posting matched every core skill and its title contained a target-role phrase with no over-experience penalty. Postings that score below the config's `min_match_score` (default 50) are dropped before the sheet write.

## Resume tailoring

For every scored posting above `resume_tailoring_min_score` (default 60), `scripts/generate_resumes.py`:

1. Reads the candidate's full profile from `context/profile.md`'s YAML frontmatter
2. Reorders the skills **within each category** and each role's bullets so ones overlapping that posting's matched skills surface first — deterministic keyword matching, no LLM calls, never rewrites or invents content
3. Fills `templates/resume_template.tex`'s placeholder tokens with the reordered content
4. Compiles it to a PDF via `tectonic` (or `pdflatex`) into `outputs/tailored_resumes/<YYYY-MM>/<YYYY-MM-DD>/`

### The skills table

`context/profile.md` groups skills into categories, and each becomes one bold-labelled row.
A LaTeX `l` column doesn't wrap — it typesets its full natural width and runs off the page —
so `generate_resumes.py` breaks each category into rows itself, packing skills into lines of
~72 characters, splitting only at commas. Continuation rows start with `&`, leaving the label
column empty so the list runs on flush underneath its own category.

Each category is capped at `max_skill_lines` rows (default 2). Past that, the entries least
relevant to *this* posting are dropped — they've already been sorted to the back — and a note
naming the count goes to stderr, so it's never silent. If a category is regularly truncated,
split it rather than raising the cap.

A profile still holding the older flat skills list renders as a single `Skills` row and keeps
working; `update-profile` migrates it when you next touch the profile.

Filenames are `<company>_<job-title>_<posting-id>.pdf`, nested by month then day so runs don't pile up in one flat folder — same date-ownership pattern `push_to_sheets.py` uses for its tab names. The intermediate `.tex` files are kept alongside in that day's `tex/` subfolder for inspection.

## Application tracker + dashboard

Independent of job-search and of the job-postings Sheet — run any time by saying "check my applications" or "update my dashboard". The `application-tracker` skill:

1. Searches Gmail broadly for application-signal emails (keywords + known ATS/recruiting sender domains), scoped to since the last scan (`archives/gmail_scan_state.json`) or the last 90 days on first run (30 days if this is the initial scan triggered by onboarding)
2. Reads each plausible thread in full and classifies it itself — Company, Role, Status (`Applied`, `Under Review`, `Assessment`, `Interview`, `Offer`, `Rejected`, `Withdrawn`, `Other`) — no fixed keyword-to-status mapping, judgment call on real content
3. Upserts the results into a dedicated **Applications** tab via `scripts/update_application_tracker.py`, keyed by Gmail thread link — re-scanning the same thread updates its row instead of duplicating it
4. Computes dashboard data via `scripts/build_dashboard_data.py` — totals by status, plus two flagged lists: **needs follow-up** (still `Applied`/`Under Review` after 7+ days of silence) and **needs a thank-you** (currently `Interview` status — a highlighted flag, not a drafted or sent email)
5. Publishes/updates a private **Claude Artifact** dashboard at a stable URL (persisted in `archives/dashboard_state.json` so re-runs update the same page instead of creating a new one each time)

**This is read-only.** It only calls Gmail's `search_threads`/`get_thread` — never `label_thread`, `label_message`, `create_label`, or any other mutation, and never drafts or sends mail. Your inbox is never modified, only read.

The Applications tab is entirely separate from the date-based job-search tabs (`2026-07-21`, etc.) and from `push_to_sheets.py`'s merge logic — it's its own tab, own schema, own scripts. The dashboard itself never references job postings at all — it's built purely from what Gmail says about your applications, independent of whether/how a posting came from this tool.

## Google Sheet layout

Each run writes to a tab named by date, for example `2026-07-21`. Columns:

1. Match Score
2. Source
3. Job Title
4. Company
5. Location
6. Experience Required
7. Seniority
8. Employment Type
9. Skills Matched
10. Posted
11. Applicants
12. Job Description
13. Apply Link
14. Fetched At
15. Posting ID
16. New Since Last Run

Header row bold, freeze first row, filter on all columns, sorted by Match Score descending.

**Same-day re-runs merge into the existing tab.** Rows are keyed by apply link — new postings are appended, and postings that already appear are refreshed with the latest score/details. A new calendar day starts a fresh tab. If the tab's header row doesn't match the current schema (e.g., after a code update that adds a column), the existing rows are discarded and the tab is rewritten with just the current run's data — no half-schema stitching.

**Posting ID** is a stable hash of each posting's apply link (or company+title+location+source if it has no link) — the same posting gets the same ID on every run, which is what makes cross-day comparison possible. **New Since Last Run** compares today's Posting IDs against the most recent *previous* date tab and marks `Yes`/`No` — pure visibility, nothing is ever dropped from the sheet based on this; a still-open posting keeps showing up across days. If there's no comparable previous tab yet (first run, or an older tab from before this column existed), everything is marked `Yes` and the run's printed summary says so explicitly rather than treating it as a silent default.

**Source** is tagged at fetch time (`LinkedIn`, or `<Company> Careers` for direct career-site postings), so adding another portal later just means a new fetch script that tags `Source` differently — score/push code stays unchanged. The **Applications** tab (see above) is a separate, non-date-named tab in the same spreadsheet — not part of this rotation.

## First message to Claude Code

Open Claude Code in the project folder and say:

> Onboard me — here's my resume.

(attach your fullest resume PDF). Once your profile exists, just say:

> Find jobs for me

And whenever you want a status check:

> Check my applications

That's the whole loop.
