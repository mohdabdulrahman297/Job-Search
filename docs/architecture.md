# Architecture

How Job Search OS is put together: what happens when someone talks to it, which skill handles what, which scripts do the work, and where secrets are allowed to go.

Diagrams are Mermaid, so GitHub renders them inline.

---

## 1. Routing — what happens when someone says something

Everything starts here. The single most important branch is whether a profile exists yet.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    U(["User says something"]) --> P{"context/profile.md<br/>exists?"}
    P -- No --> ONB["/onboard<br/>first-run setup"]
    P -- Yes --> INTENT{"What are they<br/>asking for?"}

    INTENT -- "'I got my cert'<br/>'here's my new resume'" --> UPD["/update-profile"]
    INTENT -- "'find jobs for me'" --> JS["/job-search"]
    INTENT -- "'make me a resume'<br/>pastes a JD" --> TR["/tailor-resumes"]
    INTENT -- "'check my applications'" --> AT["/application-tracker"]
    INTENT -- "'set up my keys'<br/>'is Gmail connected?'" --> CON["/connections"]

    ONB --> DONE(["Ready to search"])
    UPD --> DONE
    JS -- "offers" --> TR
    TR --> DONE
    AT --> DONE
    CON --> DONE
```

Onboarding wins over the literal request: if there's no profile, "find jobs for me" runs `/onboard` first, because a search without a profile has nothing to search *for*.

---

## 2. `/onboard` — first run only

Runs once. If a profile already exists it hands off to `/update-profile` rather than duplicating that logic.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    RESUME(["Entry"]) --> STATE{"context/setup-state.md<br/>exists?"}
    STATE -- Yes --> SKIP["Resume at the first<br/>incomplete phase; say what's skipped"]
    STATE -- No --> P0
    SKIP --> P0["Phase 0 — preflight:<br/>venv, check_connections.py,<br/>Gmail list_labels"]
    P0 --> TELL["Name every gap and what it blocks<br/>collects nothing, blocks nothing"]
    TELL --> P1["Phase 1 — get the resume:<br/>attachment first, else absolute path<br/>never search the filesystem"]
    P1 --> P2["Phase 2 — parse every page,<br/>every role, verbatim bullets<br/>then propose 5-8 target roles"]
    P2 --> CONF{"Candidate<br/>confirms the list?"}
    CONF -- "edits / adds / removes" --> P2
    CONF -- "approved" --> P3["Phase 3 — write<br/>context/profile.md + configs/search.json"]
    P3 --> REV{"Phase 3 review —<br/>roles, skill categories,<br/>location accurate?"}
    REV -- "corrections" --> P3
    REV -- "confirmed" --> P4["Phase 4 — invoke /connections<br/>for whatever Phase 0 flagged"]
    P4 --> GM{"Gmail<br/>connected?"}
    GM -- No --> ASK["Phase 5 — ask them to connect it<br/>REQUIRED, never skipped past"]
    ASK -- "connects" --> P5
    ASK -- "declines / can't now" --> INC["carry 'Gmail missing'<br/>forward to the close"]
    GM -- Yes --> P5{"Phase 5 — want Gmail<br/>application tracking now?"}
    P5 -- Yes --> AT["invoke /application-tracker<br/>30-day first scan"]
    P5 -- No --> P6
    AT --> P6{"Phase 6 — all three<br/>connections up?"}
    INC --> P6
    P6 -- Yes --> DONE["✓ You're set up"]
    P6 -- No --> GAP["Setup is incomplete:<br/>name what's missing and what it costs"]
```

Every phase is checkpointed to `context/setup-state.md`, so an interrupted setup resumes where it stopped instead of starting over — the Google Cloud leg in particular often needs a second sitting.

Two things are **always** confirmed, never silently inferred: the target-roles list, and the parsed profile itself (Phase 3's review gate). A resume can support several directions, and a parsing slip propagates into every match score and every generated resume.

**All three connections are required — Apify, Sheets, and Gmail.** Gmail used to be presented as optional, which meant candidates skipped it and silently lost application tracking and the dashboard. It's now asked for like the other two, and the close only prints a ✓ when all three are up. It still doesn't hard-block: someone who can't authorize a connector right now shouldn't be stranded mid-setup, so the run finishes and reports itself as incomplete.

Credentials are collected in Phase 4, not Phase 0, on purpose. Phase 0 tells the candidate what's coming so nothing surprises them later; doing the profile work first means they see the tool work before spending ten minutes in the Google Cloud console.

---

## 3. `/update-profile` — every change after setup

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    IN(["Profile change requested"]) --> SNAP["Step 1 — snapshot profile + config<br/>to archives/onboard-{timestamp}/"]
    SNAP --> MODE{"What kind<br/>of change?"}
    MODE -- "'I got my AWS cert'" --> A["Step 2a — apply the edit directly<br/>to the right frontmatter section"]
    MODE -- "new resume PDF" --> B["Step 2b — parse, then diff<br/>against the existing profile"]
    B --> ASK["Present the differences in plain language"]
    ASK --> PICK["Apply only what's confirmed<br/>a dropped item is surfaced, never auto-deleted"]
    A --> Q{"Did anything config-relevant<br/>change? skills / experience /<br/>location / direction"}
    PICK --> Q
    Q -- Yes --> RE["Re-derive configs/search.json<br/>+ re-confirm target roles"]
    Q -- No --> LEAVE["Leave configs/search.json alone"]
    RE --> CLOSE["Step 4 — say what changed and where"]
    LEAVE --> CLOSE
```

A new certificate with no new skills shouldn't trigger a config rewrite or another round of questions — that's what the `Q` branch protects.

---

## 4. `/connections` — check first, only ask about what's broken

This is what makes verifying on **every** run tolerable instead of nagging.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    IN(["Called by a skill, or directly"]) --> CHK["scripts/check_connections.py --scope ..."]
    CHK --> OK{"Exit code"}
    OK -- "0 — all valid" --> TERSE["One line: 'Connections look good'<br/>STOP — no questions"]
    OK -- "1 — something's wrong" --> SCAF["Step 2 — scripts/init_env.py<br/>scaffold .env, print its path"]
    SCAF --> SEQ["Hand over the COMPLETE sequences up front:<br/>Apify (4 steps) + Google Cloud (9 steps)"]
    SEQ --> TOK["Step 3 — APIFY_TOKEN<br/>candidate types it into .env"]
    TOK --> V1{"check --scope apify"}
    V1 -- invalid --> TOK
    V1 -- valid --> KEY["JSON_KEY_BASE_64<br/>ask for the FILE PATH only"]
    KEY --> ENC["set_env_value.py --from-file-base64<br/>encoded in-process, never displayed"]
    ENC --> EMAIL["check --scope sheets<br/>prints the service-account email"]
    EMAIL --> SHARE["Give them that address<br/>step 9: share the sheet as Editor"]
    SHARE --> V2{"SHEET_ID valid?"}
    V2 -- "permission denied / not found" --> SHARE
    V2 -- valid --> REV["Step 4 — re-run full scope<br/>typing a value isn't proof it works"]
    REV --> LL["Step 5 — Gmail list_labels<br/>direct MCP call, not a script"]
    LL --> GM{"Connected?"}
    GM -- No --> ASK["Give the connect steps<br/>REQUIRED — ask, don't offer to skip"]
    ASK -- "connects" --> LL
    ASK -- "can't right now" --> UPD
    GM -- Yes --> UPD["Step 6 — update connections.md<br/>for what was actually verified"]
    UPD --> REP["Step 7 — report what's missing<br/>and what it costs"]
    TERSE --> RET(["Return to caller"])
    REP --> RET
```

Gmail is checked with a direct MCP call because MCP tools aren't reachable from a subprocess — everything else goes through the script. It is **not** conditional on the caller: all three connections are required, so Gmail is checked on every interactive run.

**No credential enters the conversation.** Two of the three values are typed by the candidate straight into `.env` and never seen; the third is read from a file path. Each key is verified before the next is asked for, so a failure is always attributable to one thing. Step 9 — sharing the sheet with the service account — is the step people miss, so it loops until the check passes rather than being taken on trust.

---

## 5. `/job-search` — ends at the sheet

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    PRE["Prereqs: profile + config exist,<br/>venv ready"] --> CON["/connections — scope apify,sheets"]
    CON --> S0{"Step 0 — which sources?<br/>asked every run"}
    S0 -- "LinkedIn" --> F1
    S0 -- "both" --> F1
    S0 -- "career sites" --> F2
    F1["Announce first: N searches,<br/>expected duration, destination<br/>then fetch_jobs.py → outputs/raw_linkedin.json"] --> SC
    S0 -- "both" --> F2["fetch_companies.py --list,<br/>then --only per company, announced one at a time<br/>→ outputs/raw_companies/*.json"]
    F2 --> SC["score_jobs.py<br/>dedupe ×2 · country filter · age filter<br/>· stable posting_id → outputs/scored.json"]
    SC --> PUSH["push_to_sheets.py<br/>date tab + 'New Since Last Run'"]
    PUSH --> SUM["Step 5 — sheet URL + summary"]
    SUM --> OFFER{"Step 6 — 'N score above 60.<br/>Want resumes?'"}
    OFFER -- Yes --> TR["/tailor-resumes"]
    OFFER -- No --> STOP(["Done — results are safe in the sheet"])
```

The skill deliberately **stops at the sheet**. Resume generation is a separate skill so a LaTeX failure or an unwanted 40-PDF compile can't ride on top of a search that already succeeded.

If `configs/companies.json` doesn't exist, Step 0 is skipped entirely — there's nothing to choose between.

**Both fetch legs report progress, by different means.** The career-site leg is genuinely divisible, so it runs one company per call (`--only`) and prints a line each. The LinkedIn leg is one Apify actor run that can't be split without paying startup cost per role, so it gets an announcement instead: how many searches, how long to expect, and where results land. Neither leg should ever be a silent multi-minute block.

---

## 6. `/tailor-resumes` — five ways in

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    IN(["'Make me a resume'"]) --> LTX{"tectonic or pdflatex<br/>on PATH?"}
    LTX -- No --> INSTALL["try brew install tectonic;<br/>if that fails, stop — nothing works without it"]
    LTX -- Yes --> MODE{"From a search,<br/>or a pasted JD?"}

    MODE -- "search" --> LIST["Read outputs/scored.json,<br/>list qualifying postings"]
    LIST --> PICK{"Which ones?"}
    PICK -- "all above threshold" --> GEN_T["generate_resumes.py<br/>no flag — script's own filter"]
    PICK -- "top N" --> GEN_S
    PICK -- "above a custom bar" --> GEN_S
    PICK -- "these specific ones" --> GEN_S["generate_resumes.py<br/>--only-posting-ids<br/>THRESHOLD BYPASSED"]

    MODE -- "pasted JD" --> MJD["make_manual_posting.py<br/>scores the JD with the same rules"]
    MJD --> SCORE["Report the real score first<br/>'this matches 45% — still want it?'"]
    SCORE --> GEN_S

    GEN_T --> OUT["outputs/tailored_resumes/<br/>YYYY-MM/YYYY-MM-DD/"]
    GEN_S --> OUT
    OUT --> REP["Step 5 — count, location,<br/>and any compile failures named"]
```

`--only-posting-ids` bypassing the threshold is what makes modes 2–5 work: an explicit human choice outranks a configured default, including for a pasted JD that scores below the bar.

Manual-JD resumes are **not** written to the sheet — they didn't come from a search, and adding them would corrupt the record of what each day's search actually found.

---

## 7. `/application-tracker` — Gmail in, dashboard out

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    S0["Step 0 — /connections<br/>scope sheets + Gmail check"] --> GM{"Gmail<br/>authorized?"}
    GM -- No --> STOP(["Stop — nothing works without it"])
    GM -- Yes --> S1["Step 1 — scan window:<br/>since last scan, else 90d<br/>30d if called from onboarding"]
    S1 --> S2["Step 2 — search_threads<br/>keywords + ATS sender domains"]
    S2 --> S3["Step 3 — get_thread, then<br/>classify each: company, role, status"]
    S3 --> S4["Step 4 — update_application_tracker.py<br/>upsert into the Applications tab"]
    S4 --> S5["Step 5 — save archives/gmail_scan_state.json"]
    S5 --> S6["Step 6 — build_dashboard_data.py<br/>counts + follow-up + thank-you flags"]
    S6 --> S7["Step 7 — publish/update the<br/>Claude Artifact dashboard"]
    S7 --> S8["Step 8 — summary + dashboard URL"]
```

**Read-only, always** — `search_threads` and `get_thread` only. Never labels, never mutations, never a drafted or sent email. The "send a thank-you" idea is a *flag on the dashboard*, nothing more.

The dashboard URL is persisted in `archives/dashboard_state.json` so re-runs update the same page instead of creating a new one each time.

---

## 8. The secrets boundary

The one architectural rule that isn't about convenience.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph CTX["Claude's context — secrets NEVER live here"]
        C["Skills and reasoning"]
    end

    subgraph SCRIPTS["Scripts — the only place secret values exist"]
        CC["check_connections.py"]
        SEV["set_env_value.py"]
        OTHER["fetch_jobs.py · push_to_sheets.py<br/>build_dashboard_data.py · ..."]
    end

    ENV[(".env")]
    USER(["The candidate,<br/>in their own editor"])
    KEYFILE[("service-account.json<br/>OUTSIDE the repo")]

    USER -- "types APIFY_TOKEN and SHEET_ID<br/>directly — Claude never sees them" --> ENV
    C -- "init_env.py — creates the file,<br/>never reads it back" --> ENV
    USER -- "gives a FILE PATH<br/>never the contents" --> C
    C -- "--from-file-base64 <path>" --> SEV
    KEYFILE -- "read + encoded in-process" --> SEV
    SEV -- "writes" --> ENV
    ENV -- "load_dotenv, in-process" --> CC
    ENV -- "load_dotenv, in-process" --> OTHER
    CC -- "'valid' / 'invalid' / 'missing'<br/>NEVER a value" --> C
    C -. "BLOCKED by deny rules<br/>and by instruction" .-x ENV
```

Rules this encodes:

- **No credential ever enters the conversation.** Claude never asks for the *contents* of a token or a key file — not to store one, not to encode one, not to verify one. The only credential-adjacent thing it may ask for is a **file path**. A value typed into chat is in the transcript permanently, and no downstream handling can undo that.
- Claude never reads, `cat`s, `grep`s, or `sed`s `.env` — not even to check whether a key is set. `Read(./.env*)` is denied in `.claude/settings.json`, which is **tracked**, so a fresh clone inherits the protection rather than just the prose.
- Status comes out as a word, never a value. No lengths, no prefixes, no suffixes.
- The service-account key file **stays outside the repo** and is referenced by absolute path. Inside a git working tree it eventually gets committed, and that leaks the whole account.
- `--from-file-base64` encodes in-process, so the blob never reaches a terminal or clipboard. Base64 of the whole file is the only supported encoding — it carries `private_key`'s literal `\n` through untouched, which is what removes the escaping question entirely.
- API tokens are sent as `Authorization` headers, never URL query params — a token in a URL leaks into `requests` exception messages, which get printed and logged.

---

## 9. Files and where they come from

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    ATTACH(["Resume attached to the conversation<br/>— preferred — else an absolute path"]) --> R["resumes/resume.pdf"]
    R --> ONB["/onboard or /update-profile"]
    ONB --> PROF["context/profile.md<br/>PII, gitignored"]
    ONB --> CFG["configs/search.json<br/>personal, gitignored"]
    ONB --> STATE["context/setup-state.md<br/>phase checkpoints, gitignored"]
    COMP["configs/companies.json<br/>tracked — not personal"] --> JS

    PROF --> JS["/job-search"]
    CFG --> JS
    JS --> RAW["outputs/raw_linkedin.json<br/>outputs/raw_companies/*.json — one per company"]
    RAW --> SCORED["outputs/scored.json"]
    SCORED --> SHEET[("Google Sheet<br/>date tabs")]
    SCORED --> TR["/tailor-resumes"]
    PROF --> TR
    TPL["templates/resume_template.tex<br/>+ resume.cls"] --> TR
    TR --> PDFS["outputs/tailored_resumes/<br/>YYYY-MM/YYYY-MM-DD/"]

    GMAIL[("Gmail<br/>read-only")] --> AT["/application-tracker"]
    AT --> APPTAB[("Google Sheet<br/>Applications tab")]
    APPTAB --> DASH["outputs/dashboard_data.json"]
    DASH --> ART[("Claude Artifact<br/>dashboard")]
```

The resume is never found by searching the filesystem — it is either attached to the conversation or named by absolute path. Picking up a stale PDF silently poisons the profile, and every score and resume downstream of it.

The two halves are **deliberately unconnected**: the job-postings sheet and the Gmail dashboard never reference each other. The sheet is what the search found; the dashboard is what email says happened to applications — including ones this tool never surfaced.

---

## Design rules worth knowing

| Rule | Why |
|---|---|
| Scripts are dumb; Claude reasons | No LLM calls inside code. Scripts take a config, produce data — testable in isolation, zero token cost per row. |
| MCP for judgment, scripts for plumbing | Gmail needs an MCP because classifying an email is real reasoning. Sheets is a script because merging rows isn't. |
| Verify, don't assume | Company ATS details are confirmed against real endpoints, never guessed. A stored credential is checked with a live call, not a presence check. |
| Fail visibly, never silently | Per-item failures are logged and skipped; pipeline failures stop the run. A posting whose date can't be parsed is kept *and counted*. |
| Explicit choice beats configuration | `--only-posting-ids` overrides the score threshold, because a person naming a posting outranks a default. |

See [`decisions/log.md`](../decisions/log.md) for the reasoning behind specific choices, and [`connections.md`](../connections.md) for what's wired to what.
